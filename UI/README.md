## Amazon Transcribe Websocket Static

[Try it out](https://transcribe-websockets.go-aws.com/)

A static site demonstrating real-time audio transcription via Amazon Transcribe over a WebSocket.

This demo app uses browser microphone input and client-side JavaScript to demonstrate the real-time streaming audio transcription capability of [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) using WebSockets.

Check out the [Amazon Transcribe WebSocket docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/websocket.html).

## Building and Deploying

Even though this is a static site consisting only of HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, there is a build step required. Some of the modules used were originally made for server-side code and do not work natively in the browser.

We use [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) to enable browser support for the JavaScript modules we `require()`.

1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run-script build` to generate `dist/main.js`.

Once you've bundled the JavaScript, all you need is a webserver. For example, from your project directory: 

```
npm install --global local-web-server
ws
```
